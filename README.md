# Cyclone Language

This is an attempt to update cyclone for modern systems.

Forked from https://github.com/mingodad/cyclone, who got it to build on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Docker Image

```shell
# to build the image
docker build -t cyclone .
# enter container with cyclone available
docker run --rm -it cyclone
```

A compressed archive of cyclone will be available at `/cyclone/cyclone-linux-i686.tgz`
